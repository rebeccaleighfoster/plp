**Boolean values in C++:** The boolean values in C++ are `true` and `false`.

**Conditional statements:** C++ supports if/else, if/else if/else, and switch statements. Additionally, C++ offers the ternary conditional operator (`?:`) as a concise way to write simple if/else conditions.

**Short-circuit evaluation:** Yes, C++ supports short-circuit evaluation. The second operand of logical operators (`&&` and `||`) is evaluated only if necessary.

**Dangling else problem:** C++ resolves the dangling else problem by associating each else with the closest preceding unmatched if statement.

**Switch statements and "break":** In C++, the `break` statement is used in switch statements to exit the switch block after a case is matched. Without the break, subsequent cases will be evaluated until a break is encountered.
