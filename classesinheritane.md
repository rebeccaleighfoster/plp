### Objects and Inheritance in C++

**Objects or Similar Constructs:**

C++ supports objects through classes, which can have attributes (instance variables) and member functions (methods).

**Naming Conventions:** There are no strict naming conventions for objects, but it is common to use CamelCase for class names and lowercase for instance variables and functions.

**Standard Methods for Object Functions:**

C++ does not have a standardized method like `toString()` in Java or `__str__` in Python. However, C++ provides the `<<` operator overloading for objects, allowing customized output using streams.

**Inheritance in C++:**

C++ supports inheritance through classes. A class can inherit attributes and member functions from a base class, creating a derived class.

**Syntax:** To declare a class that inherits from a base class, use the following format:

```cpp
class DerivedClass : access_specifier BaseClass {
    // Derived class members
};


### Objects and Inheritance in C++

**Inheritance in C++:**

C++ supports inheritance through classes. A class can inherit attributes and member functions from a base class, creating a derived class.

**Syntax:** To declare a class that inherits from a base class, use the following format:

```cpp
class DerivedClass : access_specifier BaseClass {
    // Derived class members
};

access_specifier can be public, protected, or private, controlling the visibility of inherited members.

### Overloading Method Names in **Inheritance:**

C++ allows method overloading in both base and derived classes. Methods in the derived class can have the same name as those in the base class, but they must have a different parameter list.

The derived class's method with the same name as the base class's method will override the base class's method. To explicitly call the base class's method from the derived class, use the scope resolution operator ::.

###Additional Notes on Objects and **Inheritance in C++:**

C++ supports single inheritance, meaning a class can inherit from only one base class. However, it supports multiple levels of inheritance, allowing classes to inherit from other derived classes.
C++ also supports polymorphism through virtual functions and abstract classes, enabling dynamic method binding at runtime.
When using inheritance, be mindful of access specifiers (public, protected, private) to control the visibility of inherited members in the derived class.
C++ does not provide built-in garbage collection for objects; you are responsible for memory management using constructors, destructors, and smart pointers.
