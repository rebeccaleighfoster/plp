### Week 3 Write-up:

**Goals from Previous Week and Initial Proposal:**
In the previous week, my goal was to work on the Weaving Calculator project, aiming to assist weavers in calculating material requirements for different weaving projects. I aimed to allow users to input fabric dimensions, sett (threads per inch), and shrinkage, and have the program calculate the required yardage, warp length, and number of threads needed. Additionally, I intended to create a side-by-side boxplot visualization to compare password strength for different levels of categories.

**Accomplishments for This Week:**
During this week, I built upon the foundation laid in the previous week. I successfully implemented a feature to calculate the weft length needed, which adds to the overall functionality of the Weaving Calculator. Additionally, I started working on the structural aspects of the project, introducing the concept of weaver profiles. This is still not finished, but hopefully soon, users will now have the ability to create and manage profiles, which will store personalized weaving preferences and settings.

**Assessment of Progress:**
The progress this week felt more balanced, with both coding and big picture project design aspects being addressed. The incorporation of weft length calculations went smoothly and according to plan. However, the implementation of weaver profiles required more consideration than anticipated. Defining the data structure and interaction flow for profiles proved to be a thoughtful process, ensuring the program's flexibility and scalability in the future.

**Goals for Next Week:**
For the upcoming week, along with debugging my previous code, I aim to further develop the weaver profiles feature, adding functionalities such as profile creation, editing, and deletion (maybe?). By the end of next week, I aim to have a functional version of the program that can handle multiple user profiles and accurately calculate material requirements based on individual preferences. Simultaneously, I will continue to refine the project's big picture, ensuring a clear understanding of its completed form.

Overall, I'm satisfied with the progress made in integrating new features and refining the project's design. The development of weaver profiles adds depth to the project, and I look forward to realizing its full potential in the coming weeks.
