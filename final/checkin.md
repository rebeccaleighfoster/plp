### Week 1 Write-up:

**Goals from Previous Week and Initial Proposal:**
In the previous week, I set out to work on the Weaving Calculator project, a tool to assist weavers in calculating material requirements for different weaving projects. The goal was to allow users to input fabric dimensions, sett (threads per inch), and shrinkage, and have the program calculate the required yardage, warp length, and number of threads needed. Additionally, I aimed to create a side-by-side boxplot visualization to compare password strength for different levels of categories.

**Accomplishments for This Week:**
During this week, I made significant progress on the Weaving Calculator project. I successfully implemented the calculations for determining the required yardage, warp length, and number of threads based on user inputs. The program is now able to take user inputs for fabric length, fabric width, sett, and shrinkage, and provide accurate material requirements. The coding part went faster than expected, and I'm satisfied with the functionality achieved.

**Assessment of Progress:**
Despite the coding progress being faster, I still face challenges with the overall project's design and vision. While I have successfully implemented a clear part of the program, I find it challenging to envision how the complete project will look and function. The integration of various features and ensuring a cohesive user experience remain unclear to me.

**Goals for Next Week:**
For the upcoming week, I aim to accomplish one additional feature of the program's code to further enhance its functionality. This could include improving the user interface, adding error handling for invalid inputs, or implementing a feature that allows users to save and load their weaving projects. Additionally, I intend to focus on gaining a clearer vision of the big picture for the project. To achieve this, I will outline the program's main components, plan the user interaction flow, and create a rough sketch of the user interface. This will help me better understand how all the features come together and ensure a more coherent and user-friendly project.

Overall, I feel optimistic about the progress made so far and the potential of the Weaving Calculator project. By continuing to build on the existing code and defining a comprehensive project vision, I believe I can create a valuable and practical tool for weavers.
