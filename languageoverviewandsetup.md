### What is the name of your language?

C++

### When/where was it created, and by whom? Was it written to address a particular problem or need?

C++ was created in 1983 by Bjarne Stroustrup. It evolved from the C programming language with the aim of adding object-oriented programming (OOP) features while retaining the efficiency and low-level capabilities of C. The development of C++ was driven by the need to enhance the programming language's expressiveness and support for larger-scale software development.

### What types of programming is your language primarily used for (ex: web sites, video games, mobile devices, parsing, etc.). If your language is multi-purpose, provide some examples of different projects it's been used for.

C++ is a multi-purpose programming language that is used in a wide range of domains. Some primary areas where C++ excels include:

- Systems programming: C++ allows for low-level memory manipulation and direct hardware access, making it suitable for developing operating systems, device drivers, embedded systems, and other system-level software.
- Game development: C++ is commonly used in the game industry due to its performance and control over hardware resources. Engines like Unreal Engine and Unity use C++ extensively, and many popular games have been built with C++.
- High-performance applications: C++ is often used to develop performance-critical applications such as financial systems, scientific simulations, real-time systems, and image/video processing software.
- Libraries and frameworks: Many popular libraries and frameworks are implemented in C++, providing functionality to other programming languages. Examples include the Standard Template Library (STL), Boost, and OpenCV.

### Where will you get information about this language when it's time to start programming in it? At the end of your assignment, provide a list of the names of books, website URLs, or any other resources that relate to your language in particular.

When starting to program in C++, you can find information and resources from various sources. Here are some recommended books and websites to help you learn and explore C++:

Books:
- "The C++ Programming Language" by Bjarne Stroustrup
- "Effective C++" by Scott Meyers
- "C++ Primer" by Stanley B. Lippman, Josée Lajoie, and Barbara E. Moo
- "C++ Templates: The Complete Guide" by David Vandevoorde and Nicolai M. Josuttis

Websites and online resources:
- C++ Reference: [https://en.cppreference.com/](https://en.cppreference.com/)
- C++ Standard Committee: [https://isocpp.org/](https://isocpp.org/)
- Stack Overflow (C++ tag): [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/c%2B%2B](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/c%2B%2B)
- CppCon (C++ conference talks): [https://www.youtube.com/user/CppCon](https://www.youtube.com/user/CppCon)

These resources provide comprehensive documentation, tutorials, examples, and community support to help you learn and master C++.

### What did you need to do to install the language?

To install C++, you will need to set up a development environment that includes a C++ compiler. The installation process may vary depending on your operating system.

For Windows:
1. Install an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, or Dev-C++.
2. Follow the installation instructions provided by the chosen IDE.

For macOS:
1. Install Xcode, which includes the Clang C++ compiler.
2. Open the Terminal and type `xcode-select


### How do you run programs in that language?

To run programs written in C++, you need to follow these steps:

1. Write your C++ code in a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
2. Save the file with a `.cpp` extension, indicating it is a C++ source code file.
3. Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where your C++ file is saved.
4. Compile the C++ source code using a C++ compiler. For example, if you have GCC installed, you can run `g++ filename.cpp -o output` to compile the code and generate an executable file named `output`.
5. Once the compilation is successful, run the generated executable by typing `./output` (replace `output` with the actual executable name) in the command prompt or terminal.
6. The program will execute, and you will see the output on the console.

### How do you write comments in your language?

In C++, you can write comments to add explanatory or descriptive text that is ignored by the compiler. There are two types of comments:

1. Single-line comments: Use `//` to indicate a single-line comment. Everything after `//` on the same line will be considered a comment.

2. Multi-line comments: Enclose multi-line comments between `/*` and `*/`. Everything between these markers will be treated as a comment, even if it spans multiple lines.

Here's an example:

```cpp
// This is a single-line comment

/*
   This is a multi-line comment.
   It can span multiple lines.
*/

// Code statements below
int x = 5; // This is another single-line comment
